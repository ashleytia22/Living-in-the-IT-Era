        <p>I am Ashley Tia B. Olarte, born on February 22, 2002, marking a journey that has led me to the present moment of academic pursuit and personal growth. Currently enrolled as a Bachelor of Arts in English Language Studies (BAELS) student at Mindanao State University, I am engaged in mastering the intricacies of HTML, a foundational element in modern communication and technology. My journey in self-discovery has led me from being an extrovert, particularly during my high school days, to embracing the nuances of being an ambivert in college and various settings. One of my guiding principles in life is to extend deadlines when feasible, earning me the playful title of "crammer queen." As I navigate through different aspects of my identity, I find myself exploring both masculine and feminine expressions. This includes a newfound passion for makeup artistry and elegant attire, embodying my evolving appreciation for femininity. Astrologically, I align with the traits of a Pisces, embodying qualities such as sympathy, commitment, charisma, love, sensitivity, realism, and occasional forgetfulness - a blend that shapes my journey toward intelligence and confidence.</p>

	<h2 align="center"><div style="background-color:#95B9C7;">Hobbies</h2></div>
	<p>I have a passion for literature, dance, and emotional expression. While I jest about overreacting, it is a facet of my expressive nature. At times, I indulge in singing, particularly when I feel a sense of responsibility to contribute positively to the world. Writing was once a cherished pastime, yet I have come to acknowledge a shift in my skills and interests. Presently, I am dedicated to honing my acting abilities, a pursuit that presents significant challenges but offers immense personal growth. Additionally, I find enjoyment in immersing myself in series, films, and anime. Despite my penchant for venting, I remain committed to fulfilling my obligations as a young adult.</p>
	<hr>
	<h2 align="center"><div style="background-color:#95B9C7;">Skills</h2></div>
	<p>In the past, I actively participated in sports such as Taekwondo and Arnis, showcasing my physical prowess and discipline. Additionally, I explored the artistry of dance through SPA dancing and the grace of gymnastics. Currently, I do not engage in any sports, but I am contemplating acting as a new endeavor. However, I find it challenging to master due to the complexities of controlling my emotions, particularly in situations requiring emotional flexibility. This internal struggle serves as a hurdle that I am actively working to overcome, as I believe acting could be a valuable skill to develop alongside my diverse interests.</p>

	<h2 align="center"><div style="background-color:#95B9C7;">Interests</h2></div>
	<p>In terms of my interests, I greatly admire Mr. Sung Jin Woo and hold him in high regard as one of my favorite personalities. I have a tendency to delve deeply into thoughts and often express them through verbal or written rants. Additionally, I find pleasure in sharing posts on social media platforms. Music is an integral part of my life, serving as a source of inspiration and comfort. I have a strong affinity for the colors blue and black, finding them visually appealing and comforting. Observing people and enjoying moments of quiet contemplation are activities that I cherish. Furthermore, I have a fondness for coffee and indulging in sweet treats. Nature holds a special place in my heart as well, as its serene beauty has a calming effect on my mind.</p>
